# File Finder Application
This app was built using the FreshUI Java Package. It features the ability to 
select any directory (folder) and search every file inside of it, whether the 
files and folders are hidden, or not hidden.

## Using the application
Upon opening the application, you will see two text inputs, and a large button at the bottom.

The usage of this application is very straightforward. Simply put in a pathname for the directory you'd like to search through, and the pathname for where you
want the file to be saved. Or, select the 'Choose' button next to the text input. 

Once you have put in the pathnames, click "Search Directories".

The status label in the bottom left corner just above the search button should read "Searching..."

Please note that if you have not granted this application access to where you are searching, the application will freeze up at the Searching status. For more information on how to allow access, visit [this website](https://support.avast.com/en-us/article/allow-mac-full-disk-access/#mac)

When the search is finished, you should get a pop-up dialog box that confirms search completion.

You may then close the application and load the search results file that the application made. You have already specified where it should be saved. 

You may read the file, and enjoy having a fast way to see all files in a folder at once.
